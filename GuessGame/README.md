# 🎮 Number Guessing Game - React Native

A simple and interactive **Number Guessing Game** built with **React Native**. In this game, the **phone guesses your number (between 1 and 99)**, and you give it hints whether the next guess should be higher or lower. The app counts the number of rounds it takes to guess correctly!
